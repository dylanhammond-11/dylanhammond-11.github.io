title: Automated Tracking Nerf Turret
description:  I designed and created a fully 3D printed nerf turret capable of of tracking and firing at objects by color. The turret uses a usb camera paired with OpenCV to detect and track the objects. The turret is controlled by an Arduino Uno board. PID controllers are used for accurate tracking and firing.
skills: 
- Python (OpenCV)
- Arduino
- PID Controller Design
- Solidworks
