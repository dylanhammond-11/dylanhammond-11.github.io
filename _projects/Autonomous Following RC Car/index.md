title: Autonomous Following RC Car
description: I built an Arduino-based RC car that autonomously follows a user-controlled RC car (or other object) using three ultrasonic sensors and PID control. The car is based off of a closed-loop system which I made in Matlab/Simulink. Two PID controllers are used for precise and accurate following.
