title: Hand Signal Interpreting Glove
description: |
  This glove is capable of interpreting 25 hand signals and wirelessly transmitting them to control a drone, enabling discreet long-range communication even when out of sight.
  The glove uses five flex deflection sensors and an MPU6050 to collect hand gesture and finger position data. The sensors are paired with a machine learning algorithm to quickly detect hand signals at 95% accuracy.
  The glove features transmission mode toggle switches, LED indicator lights, and a custom PCB for a sleek and lightweight design.
  I worked with a group of 5 other students to create this glove for our senior capstone design project.
