title: Hand Signal Interpreting Glove
description:  This glove is capable of intrepreting 23 hand signals and wirelessly transmitting them to control a drone, enabling discreet long-range communication even when out of sight. 
The glove using five Flex deflection sensors and a MPU6050 IMU to collect hand gesture and finger position data. The sensors are paired with a machine learning algorithm to quickly detect hand signals at 95% accuracy.
The glove features transmission mode toggle switches, LED indicator lights, and a custom PCB for a sleek and lightweight design. 
I worked with a group of 5 other students to create this glove for our senior capstone design project.
