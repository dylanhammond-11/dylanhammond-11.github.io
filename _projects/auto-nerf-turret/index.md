title: Automated Tracking Nerf Turret
description: |
  I designed and made a fully 3D printed nerf turret from scratch capable of of tracking and firing at objects by color. The turret uses a usb camera paired with OpenCV to detect and track the objects. The turret is controlled by an Arduino Uno board. PID controllers are used for accurate tracking and firing.
  The turret is driven by three MG90s servo motors, two for pan and tilt contrl, and one for loading. Two DC motors drive a wheel shooter to fire the ammo.

- Python (OpenCV)
- Arduino
- PID Controller Design
- Solidworks
